I need a dump of all India Case Laws I found
[this](https://github.com/aadithya/legal) [1] repository on Github which had
scraped all the cases. The repository might not be complete but that's not an
issue now. The task now is create meta data out of the cases. Who fought, what
were the issues, who won, which court, which data etc. I'll probably have to
write a lot of regex, lets see. BTW there two other repos which might turn out
to be useful
* https://github.com/jprahladan/judgements
* https://github.com/sushant354/judis-re

The second repo is by the founder of IndianKanoon Sushant Sinha [1] :)
