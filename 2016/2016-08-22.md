* Wrote the "This week in Constitutional Law -I"
* Was reading more about using pandoc to create latex document with markdown
* Did some small improvements on the EME diversity paper I was writing.
* Created account on arxiv and was reading through their system, apparently you
    need endorsement by someone to publish paper on ArXiV. Will figure out
    tomorrow who can I take endorsement from.
