Today for sympy I was working on the Range to make it work with oo and -oo.

Then I was doing writing some simulations to find the rate of unfavourable
resessive trait, it was pretty interesting details of its are written as
comments in the code. And opening facebook especially while working on
something interesting is a pretty bad idea, a very bad idea.
