The GSoC project is about to end. Today I worked on

- solveset: a userlevel function to provide and interface for various
  `solve_univariate_*` functions. It was pretty easy job.

- Ran through the old logs on gitter and also I was trying to fix issues

- Matthew is particular that someone else should be able to pick up my project
and I have to write a doc explaining the intricacies of the project. Also
I have to write a tutorial for the new solvers.
