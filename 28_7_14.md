Today I worked on the solvers to make the equations with radicals work.
I worked on a pattern matching approach.
suppose you have to solve solve some equation with radical say `sqrt(x) + x - 2`,
you solve it by taking `x - 2` on the RHS and squaring on both the sides. The
squaring part is easy the difficult part is identifying which part to move to
the right hand side. First I tried to match the expression with the form
`sqrt(p) + q` but it failed even for case like `4*sqrt(x) + x - 2` because no
pattern matched to it. I had to use `a*sqrt(p) + q` with the condition that the
expression matched to a shouldn't be zero.

Now notice that this method for solving sqrt equation can work with any radical
equation, if it were cube root instead of sqrt I just had to cube both the
sides. OK so how do I mathch that expression? I tried to pattern matching with
assumptions on the wild symbols but it doesn't work. F.B has proposed a new
pattern matcher and if it is implemented then things will be good but I can't
wait for it. I tried to match with somthing like `a*p**Rational(1, m) + q` but
this also didn't work out because Rational(1, m) raises TypeError no matter
what the assumption on the variable are. I had no other option to check term by
term for rational power. Here's the implementation

```

def _has_rational_power(expr):
    a, p, q = Wild('a'), Wild('p'), Wild('q')
    pattern_match = expr.match(a*p**q)
    if pattern_match is None or pattern_match[a] is S.Zero:
        return (False, None)
    elif isinstance(pattern_match[q], Rational):
        if not pattern_match[q].q == S.One:
            return (True, pattern_match[q].q)

    if not isinstance(pattern_match[a], Pow) or isinstance(pattern_match[a], Mul):
        return (False, None)
    else:
        return _has_rational_power(pattern_match[a])
```

My first approach was to choose the first term which had a rational power as
rhs. But later I figured out in cases like `sqrt(x) + sqrt(sqrt(x)) + 4` it
important to put `sqrt(sqrt(x))` at the RHS rather than `sqrt(x)`, so
I modified the program to choose the term with the highest denominator in the
Rational power as the RHS. OK this method won't work if we had sqrt(sqrt(x) + x)
instead, I'll have to take care of it. Then the tests are too untidy I have to
clean them up and organise them in logical units.

One problem with the above approach if done wrong, the expression keeps growing
fills the whole memory, I'll have to figure out some conditions to indentify or
at least prevent there cases. For now I have put a check that if the number of
terms of the expression grows larger than 100 raise a Value Error
