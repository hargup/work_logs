* talked with Priyam and then tried to set up afra
    I had to install Ruby and related libraries, there was a program listed on
    the wiki but for some reason it failed to download the ruby source using
    ftp and then I had to manually make and install it. Purging the existing
    ruby installed from apt-get also purged the installation of vim. I'll now
    have to manually install it from source. Or somehow change the dependency
    list of vim-gtk to accept ruby2.x
    The there was some problem with rake which is a tool to set up gems and
    build dependencies. I'll try to figure it out tomorrow, else I'll ask
    Priyam or Vivek.

    basepair.
