What the Fuck, only the last object being imported is undefined be it
expectedOutTranscript or inTranscript
Negative Test for this Hypothesis: Import EditTrack after everything else
OK the negative test failed :D, it is not the last function being imported.
Maybe it has something to do with circular dependencies in OutTranscript and
InTranscript? But it is not a very testable hypothesis. OK lets see if
moving import of EditTrack to the end fixes something, even if it does
I have to figure why was it undefined. Oh Boy got the answer now. Thanks to
Priyam! The number
of files from which I'm importing is not same as the number of the objects
I was importing. The EditTrack import worked because that import wasn't
really being used. TODO: write a small vim script to inter date in the
format:   <time> <date> <month> <year> <time zone>
