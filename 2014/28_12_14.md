// I need to build a framework to laod and test the transcripts. The current
// system isn't going to work. Probably I should create json files
// corresponding to each test file and it will contain all the input and
// expected transcripts with the parameters that we have to pass to the
// resizeExon function. But the issue with this solution is that this way
// I will not be able to use those transcripts for other functions. Maybe we
// should just have one JSON corresponding to a transcript. We can have them
// versioned like transcript1_1.json transcript1_2.json and when they will be
// parsed we can have all of them is an array. For `resizeExon` we also need
// a way to specify which exon we are selecting. Okay that should be in the
// testing case. How is it for the mergeTranscript function? It should be fine
// for that too. So go ahead. SO I'll create a directory `transcripts` under
// `data` directory and will have transcripts with file name 1_1.json which we
// be loading as a 2D array of transcripts.
