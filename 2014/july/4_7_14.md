Today I tried to write an implementation for the
`ImageSet(...).intersect(S.Reals)` method. I idea was discussed in the last
work log,
separate the real and imaginary parts and equate the imaginary to zero
but the problem was with the assumptions on the symbols. For example while
doing
```
In[]: (n + I*n).as_imag_real()
Out[]:(re(n) - im(n), re(n) + im(n))
```
thats becuase `n` is by default complex. I wrote some code to decide the
assumption on the variable of imageset from the baseset. I wrote it in branch
(sym_real_imageset)
that was created from a commit before the first commit of the solve_univariate
PR so that it doesn't add new commits in the PR. Then I brached off from the
head of the solver_refactor for the intersection changes. I merged the branch
I mentioned earlier. though the implementation seemed to be correct it didn't
worked out for some reason and I couldn't figure it out, I'll try my hand on it
again tomorrow.

I also tried my hands on the issue of unevaluated sqrt(I) but I guess I wasn't
persistent enough.

Then I was reading the PROlog equation solver tread on the mailing list which
mentined the PRESS paper and had some discussion about it. F.B. (guy)
mentioned a pattern matching structure for a solvers which looked promissing
but lacked a lot of necessary details I need some time to figure out what
exactly is missing from it and I'll discuss that with Matthew and Sergey, the
current approach won't scale.
