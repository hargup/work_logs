Today I didn't really wrote any code for the gene simulation but I was thinking
about the thereotical model. There are three variables
`a`: the number of XX
`b`: the number of XY + YX
`c`: the number of YY
`a + b + c = n`. Where n is fixed so we can take two of the variables as
independed and the other dependent on the two (now I realize that we can do that too).
Let's say `a'` is the number of XX in the next generation so is `b'` for XY + YX
and `c'` for YY in next gen. Lets take `d = a + c`, ok dont take that some
parts are missing the theory. **If** `a` and `c` are independent variables,
then `a'` and b' are binomially distributed in with mean in terms of a b and
c, which can be approximated by a normal distribution.
The a'', b'' and c'' for next generation will be function in random variables
a', b' and c'. Lets say the function for a'' is f(a', b', c') for b'' is g(a',
b', c') and for c'' is h(a', b', c') then the function for a''' will be f(f(a',
b', c'), g(a', b', c'), h(a', b', c')) and so on even for higher generations.
I'll have to find appropriate approximantions of this function so that I can
find the distribution of the proportions of XX and YY in them of the number of
generations and the initial populations of each specie.


THen I workon on sympy importing the multivariate solver and importing tests
from the old solver.


TODO for tomorrow:
1. Write the blog about the experiment
2. Write the sympy blog
3. Commplete the todo.
