Things I did today:

- Tried to optimize the `gene_simulate` code I was working on yesterday and day
  before it. It was so much fun I was able to reduce 18 minute run time of the
  10000 population size case to a half a minute. And that was mainly:
  - First replace all the list concatenations with the append method
  - Drop the person class: it was unnecessary now when there was no
    gender(premature abstraction). the overall time for __init__ function class
    was measurable
  - Replace `create_children` function with a dictionary call.
  - Replaced almost all the list operations with wiht np arrays, even
    I replaced the list comprehensions wiht the masked arrays
 I also did some non optimization refactoring on the code


- Install mkl
- Then was trying to get theorotical model for the observed result
- Wrote the pitch for Python
- naively imported _solve_lambertW
