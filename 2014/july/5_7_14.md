I was reading Needham's Visual complex analysis today.
Then in the night I give another hand at the ImageSet(...).intersect(S.Reals)
problem the issue was that `isinstance(self.base_set, Integers)` was in the if
block and wrote the code in another elif block the control never reached my
code for the test example because the if condition was true. The was also the
issue with `ImageSet` and imageset, the assumptions on the variable of Lambda
was set in the imageset method but the test set was a direct call of ImageSet
so no assumption were set on its variables and I was thinking something was
wrong with the variable setting, that's when unit testing came to rescue.
I recalled that I have already tested the feature and there must be something
wrong with the test case the intersection functionality. That's almost complete
except the issue that `S.Integers.intersect(S.Reals)` doesn't return
`S.Intergers`. Gotta sleep now
