`solve_univariate_real(log((x-1)*(x+1)), x)` used to fail.  The reason is the
invert function cannot invert `log((x-1)*(x+1))`.  Though it is possible to
invert this function it will solver to solve `(x-1)*(x+1)`. But there might also
be cases in solving log(f(x)) = 0 where the general inverse of f(x) might not
be known but we can solve f(x) == 1. In general inverting the whole a function
is an overkill when solving for a particular value will suffice.

Then I refactored `solve_as_poly`, there were two functions `solve_as_poly`(for
reals) and `solve_as_poly_complex` which were essentially same except they
called different solve function and different invert function. I added
additional parameters to `solve_as_poly` for the solve function and invert
function, then created anohter function `solve_as_poly_real` and passed the
real solvers and real invert function to `solve_as_poly_real` then did the same
thing with `solve_as_poly_complex` after deleting the main code form it.

I felt the decorators could help a lot in preventing code duplication, I had
read about them earier but I wasn't confident so read about them again, this
time from this blog
http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/
The author explained the concept pretty cleanly and now it clear to that
decorators (@ operator) is a syntatic sugar for closures.

I also had a meeting with Matthew today, I'm posting the log.

Yeah, I did some changes like https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7523/files#diff-ee294205aeb0b99b1b720c5aff320ed9R268
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
earlier we weren't able to solve things like
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
log((x-1)*(x+1))
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
because the invert function
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
couldn't invert it
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
but we didn't needed to invert the whole function
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
just inverting log was enough
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
this change fixes that
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
Then I tried to reduce some code duplication between real and complex solvers
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
see this
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
earlier I created two functions solve_as_poly(for real) and solve_as_poly_complex
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
they were essentially same except that they were calling different solve_univriate and invert function
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
solve_univariate_real in the first case
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
and solve_univariate_complex in the second
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
In general, from a purely aesthetic perspective, the code looks quite nice
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
It seems to be nicely organized
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
Thanks :blush:
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
When the world improves and I have more time I'd like to sit down and actually read through it
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
world improves?
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
@mrocklin I hope your lack of time is also because you are doing work for the sympy tutorial :blush:
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
Just a phrase, "when the world improves". Meaning that this is my intention but that it's probably not going to happen any time soon
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
Oh yeah, what are my obligations on that right now?
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
We can fix up exercises until next Wednesday?
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
yeah
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
OK
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
I guess I’ll take a look at the slides
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
I don’t remember who we decided was going to present them
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
At the moment my priorities are something like Blaze > girlfriend > PyToolz > SymPy. And currently my girlfriend is pretty upset with me...
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
One thought was to present a tiny intro, then do basic intro on SymPy, then do my section, then a break, then more stuff on SymPy, then do your section.
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
I never like it when tutorials start out with 20 minutes on history
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
ok
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
I’ll just build all the slides
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
I'm much more engaged in the history after I have bought into the project
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
it will be easy enough to split them up once we have them
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 2
we should basically spend the morning of the day of the tutorial putting this together
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 2
our tutorial is in the afternoon
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
@hargup any progress with trig solvers?
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
unless you will be in austin sooner
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
yeah
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
I'll be in town starting Saturday around 4pm
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
I resolved the issue with I being treated a symbol
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
but I'll have to take a look at it again
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
ah
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
And yeah, I think once I'm on the ground my priorities will probably shift
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
@skirpichev thinks it is not clean enough
asmeurer •  3 hours ago 3
we should probably grab a beer or something, but we may not actually work until sunday morning
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
I being treated as a symbol? or general approach on trig solve?
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
OK
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
I
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
I'll probably be in frantic get things together mode all throughout that week
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
I'm using the exp technique.
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
so the result for sin(x) = 0 is now
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
{2⋅π⋅n | n ∊ ℤ} ∪ {2⋅π⋅n + π | n ∊ ℤ}
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
Can you point me to where that is happening?
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 3
Hrm, right now Union.iter concatenates. it should probably interleave.
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
in Poly the imaginary unit was I was being treated a symbol https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7523/files#diff-ee294205aeb0b99b1b720c5aff320ed9R345
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
I have some fuzzy ideas on resolving few special cases of unions of imageset
hargup •  3 hours ago 3
I'll code them up and present
hargup •  3 hours ago 4
btw @asmeurer can we have a constructive proof of {2n for n in Integers} U {2n + 1for n in Integers}
hargup •  3 hours ago 4
makes up to {n for n in Integers}
hargup •  3 hours ago 4
by constructive proof I mean something that does use the answer in the solution.
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 4
@hargup anything I can help with short term? If not then I'm going to check out for the day
hargup •  3 hours ago 5
I was little confused on when to call different techniques of solving equations
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
for example in real solvers
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
we can combine log(a) + log(b) = log(a*b)
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
with out worrying about loosing solutions
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
that can be done by logcombine
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
but I was confused should I check if the equation can be solved by the technique
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
and then call logcombine
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
or apply it on generic equations
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
see if it works
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
and if doesn't
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
move to the other methods
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
I like these sorts of problems
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
My approaches tend to be strange though
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
what do you usually do?
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
I would do either:
Associate a "should I apply this function" predicate to each function. E.g funcs = {lambda expr: test_expr: logcombine, ... }
Just try a bunch of functions and see which one works best
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sympy/As1Nct87ieI/qt1WxjOI7UQJ
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
@smichr and I worked on trig simplification using method 2
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/simplify/fu.py
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
I really like that kind of approach
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
Chris Smith (smichr) wrote lots of small functions to do small simplifications on trig equations. I wrote a general search mechanism to try different fuctions. We stole a good recipe for the right order in which to apply them from a paper
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
The different functions are arranged into a tree of possible paths here https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/simplify/fu.py#L1611
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
In practice the resulting function, fu, is pretty robust and lets you choose the kind of simplified result you want, e.g. "no tans please"
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
I'm not sure that this is fully applicable to the solve case
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
But it was a neat experiment
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
it appears to be useful
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
I'll try to get my head around it.
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
simplification has the nice property that the input and output of all of the steps have the same form
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 7
This is not necessarily the case for solving
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 8
But the two approaches are similar in that there are many pieces of isolated logic
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 8
We found a lot of value in separating out those pieces into small isolated functions. Chris could think about these well on his own.
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 8
At some point in solvers it would be nice to get rid of all of the if isinstance(expr, foo) and if expr.is_foo checks, move their bodies into separate functions, and then have some external system that arranged them.
hargup •  3 hours ago 8
got it, the property gave you the freedom to call one logic on another.
mrocklin •  3 hours ago 8
But, as I said, my approaches here tend to be strange.
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
I found the approach interesting
hargup •  3 hours ago 7
I'll figure out how much of it will be applicable in solvers.
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
I wouldn't focus too much on this sort of thing, it's something I think about while I build code normally
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
For example ideally both solve_univariate_real_trigonometric_2 and solve_univariate_real_trigonometric_1 could live in the same solve system
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
And you might try both and select the best answer for the given input
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
Or someone could come in and write a third one
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
And ideally they could plug in that third (hopefully better) approach without understanding all of the rest of the code
hargup •  2 hours ago 6
the best answer could be chosen by counting the number of args of Union
hargup •  2 hours ago 6
I like this approach
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
Sure, or if the result wasnt a Union we might have an order of the return types that we like
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
E.g. we would like to avoid ImageSets
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
If we can find some other solution
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
Or maybe we prefer solutions of short string length
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
There are lots of cute things you can think about
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
But none of this is of much use if we can't actually solve equations
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
:blush:
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
My general advice is to keep working as you are, but have these ideas in mind as you work. Eventually a good refactoring comes to mind.
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
To your original question about logcombine
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
Can you think of some way to tell if a simplification makes progress or not?
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 8
How do we quantify how solvable an expression is?
hargup •  2 hours ago 8
we can count the number of args of Add
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
logcombine should reduce them
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
if it worked well
asmeurer •  2 hours ago 7
@hargup maybe ask @thilinarmtb. There might be something in the diophantine module that could help with that.
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 8
Given an arbitrary expression how do you determine that logcombine might be a good thing to try? It should contain logs and Adds?
hargup •  2 hours ago 8
yes
hargup •  2 hours ago 8
but calling log-combine shouldn't hurt
hargup •  2 hours ago 8
*calling on arbitary expression
hargup •  2 hours ago 8
if can't combine log it doesn't modify the expression
hargup •  2 hours ago 8
nor raises any errors
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
so if it changes the expression it should be good thing
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
It never does bad work?
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
cannot be sure
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
but it appears to be the case
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
This message was deleted
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
This is just because Adds are almost always bad for solve?
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
yeah, it is easy to handle Mul
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
What are other things that are always bad or always good?
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
composition of functions are better than Mul
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
Does SymPy have mechanisms to nest or denest functions?
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
we have a function to denest square roots
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
exp(x) * exp(y) -> exp(x + y)?
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
yes if exp(x) * exp(y) is in addition with something else
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
In [11]: fu(sin(x)*cos(x))
Out[11]:
sin(2⋅x)
────────
   2
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
Anyway, I'm just screwing around
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
that would be a way better example.
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
This is all pretty orthogonal to the current problems
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
which is just getting sin(x) to work :blush:
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
This should get exciting though once we have the basic pieces up and running
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
btw now I think I should add specific rule for sin and cos instead to solving them as exp or tan
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 7
I don't have much to say on that topic
hargup •  2 hours ago 7
it will add scope to play around in the manner described.
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
yeah, rule based systems do let you do lots of dumb things rather than a few smart things. I'd run the idea by @skirpichev and see what his thoughts are. He seemed to have strong opinions on this
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
I think I raised a question along these lines during the last meeting
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
and there was some good argument why not
mrocklin •  2 hours ago 6
OK, I'm going to head out
hargup •  2 hours ago 6
The argument was it won't help
