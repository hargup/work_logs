Today I worked on the PR to make union on the ImageSets work at PR
https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7673. The PR deals with a very special case
of ImageSet unions, it only simplifies the case `a*n, a*n + 1, a*n + 2, ...,
a*n + a - 1` and its variants, (constant muliplied, or + instead of -).
So now `{2*n*pi + pi for n in Integers} U {2*n*pi for n in Integers}` can be
simplified to `{n*pi for n in Integers}`.
I want to make
```
                                        ⎧        π        ⎫   ⎧        π        ⎫
{2⋅π⋅n | n ∊ ℤ} ∪ {2⋅π⋅n - π | n ∊ ℤ} ∪ ⎨2⋅π⋅n - ─ | n ∊ ℤ⎬ ∪ ⎨2⋅π⋅n + ─ | n ∊ ℤ⎬
                                        ⎩        2        ⎭   ⎩        2        ⎭
```
work but the gcd couldn't extract pi/2 as the common factor between the
expressions.

Then Chris Smith is working on fixing the power simplification, currently it
simplifies (x**y)**z to (x**(y*z)) for all cases which isn't quite correct. He
asked me to review the PR I'll have to give a through look on it tomorrow, its
important.
