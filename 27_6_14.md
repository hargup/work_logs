Today a lot of time was spent doing and preparing a fresh install of Xubuntu 14.04.
I moved all the files in the root partion to another partition of the hard drive called 210fs.
and deleted a lot of unneccessary file. I realized that knowing more about the *nix wildcards and
regex would have made my job simpler. The actual installation took only ~20 minutes but then
installing softwares afterwards took a lot of my time. Yesterday I had
written a pitch regarding using Python instead of C++ for Team AGV so I was looking
for arguments for Python and against C++. Then I was thinking of installing ros from source
but it did not appeared to a pretty easy process and could not find a proper developement guide
for ros. Something we do for Sympy, here is our main repo, this is how to actually get started
with contributing. There was no link for developement mailing list too only user list. It looks
they arent very keen about getting contributors.

Then in the day and in the night I was thinking about how to do Unions of the sets.
I feel like this problem can be somehow tranformed into some equation whos solution will
lead us to the answer. The thing is union of set is the solution of multiplication of those
equations, if I can get a combined solution of those equation the union problem is solved.
A simple case which I felt was the equation corresponding to {n*pi | n in Interges} is sin(x)=0
and the corresponding to {n*pi + pi/2 |n in Integers} is sin(x - pi/2)=0, i.e., same as cos(x)
the combined equaiton is sin(x)*cos(x)=0 ==> sin(2*x)/2 = 0, for which we know the solution is
{n*pi/2 | n in Integers}. But using sin and cos is somewhat circular as we will need the union
of sets for the solutions of the equation made out of combination of them. Maybe we can get
something like diophantine which can be solved independently of the sets. BTW how do we prove
{n*pi | n in Integers} U {n*pi + pi/2 | n in Integers} is equal to {n*pi/2 | n in Integers}
Maybe I should ask on Math.stackexchange.com.

btw Ia writing course by coursera-dl was distracted to check downloading of a writing course by coursera-dl
