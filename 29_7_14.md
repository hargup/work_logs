Today I cleaned up the tests for `solve_univariate`, deleted many of them
and organised them in logical units. Then I added log in `invert_complex`.
I though of method of the generalized solution for the equation with radicals
but it later I figured out it wasn't generalized enough. For the problem of the
unbounded growth of expression in `solve_radical` I can count the number of
radicals in the equation and them if they decrease after the power operation
then only we will proceede with the method. I'll implement this check tomorrow
