Today wasn't a very productive as far as the work is concerned.
I worked on the Set Difference PR #7462 which was stalled from
a long time. Though it worked fine it wasn't very clean in the way it
interacted with the existing complement function. And Sergey wanted to
the Difference class to renamed as Complement.

First I renamed all instances of Difference to Complement there were a lot of
them in many files and I missed the docs which Sergey pointed out in the
review.
The both the `self.complement` and `self.__sub__` method contained the logic
for Complement which was not a good thing. Since `self.complement(other)` meant
`other - self` I couldn't simply place the logic of `self.complement(other)` in
`__sub__`. I placed the logic of `.complement` methods in the
`Complement.reduce` method as global rules. But it didn't worked out, I figured
that for many instances `Complement.reduce` wasn't being even called and the
reason was that because `A - B` simply called `__sub__` if such a method was
present in `A`. But we need the `__sub__` to be called from `reduce` so
I renamed all of `__sub__` methods them to `_complement` and it worked out.
The only thing left to fix is that `self.complement(other)` behaves as `other
- self` and `self._complement(other)` behaves as `self - other`.
