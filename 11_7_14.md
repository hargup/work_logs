Today I completed the porting of the test from the old solver into the new one,
a lot of things are broken and I gotta fix them. I also recieved a mail from
Aaron that I have not written the blog post for this week and I also have to
write about the gene-simulation I've been doing. The thing I wrote day before
yestday in these logs about the theoretical model was shit and I was thinking
a lot of *wrong* things, if I don't write now I'll forget
